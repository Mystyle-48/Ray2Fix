# Ray2Fix

Ray2Fix is a collection of fixes and a configuration tool that aims to simplify setting up Rayman 2 for speedrunners.

It can also be used as a basic mod loader (can be enabled in Tweaks tab in R2FixCfg.exe).

## How to Install

- Download the [latest release zip](https://github.com/spitfirex86/Ray2Fix/releases/latest) and extract all files to Rayman 2 installation directory
- Run R2FixCfg.exe and choose your preferred display resolution
- (Optional) Configure controller input using Steam (described below)


## Using Steam to map controller input

  - Enable support for the correct controller type
  - Enable "Generic" configuration support

In Steam Library:
- Add Rayman2.exe as a non-Steam game
- Right-click Rayman 2 -> Manage -> Controller configuration
